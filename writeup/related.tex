% binary classification
There has been a wealth of recent work towards fair machine learning
algorithms. In large part, these methods have focussed (and reasonably
so) on binary classification with a binary sensitive attributes
(CITE). A concurrent goal of these works was to construct a working
definition of fairness (or unfairness) that could be evaluated and
optimized. These include fairness through unawareness/disparate
treatment\cite{grgiccase,zafar2016fairness}, demographic
parity/disparate impact \cite{zafar2015learning}, individual fairness
\cite{dwork2012fairness,zemel2013learning,louizos2015variational,joseph2016rawlsian},
equality of opportunity/disparate
mistreatment~\cite{hardt2016equality,zafar2016fairness}.

A variety of algorithmic approaches to achieving fairness have been proposed. Most similar to our work is \cite{zemel2013learning} (I have no idea which reference we're going for here).
