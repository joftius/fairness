Our main idea is to model fairness using causal graphical
models\cite{pearl:09}. Specifically we model observed feature(s) $X$,
class label(s) $Y$, and sensitive attribute(s) $A$, as nodes in a
directed acyclic graph (DAG). A directed arrow from any node $C$ to
node $E$ indicates a causal relationship from cause $C$ to effect
$E$. Mathematically, we take the approach of structural equation
models as follows: if $C$ causes $E$ then $E$ is a function of
$C$. Additionally, each node has an associated noise variable that are
jointly independent


% and a noise variable associated with $C$, called $N_C$. (CITE) 


% a causal relation

%  where a directed arrow from


% that induce a joint distribution $P(X,Y,A)$. This distribution contains conditional independeces which can be expressed by a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
